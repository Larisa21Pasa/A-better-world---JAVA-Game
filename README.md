# A-better-world---JAVA-Game
Fairy RPG is a Java-based role-playing game developed during the second year of university. 

## The project employs the following design patterns and technical structures:

Singleton Pattern: Utilized in the Camera class to ensure a single instance controls the game's view.

Object-Oriented Design: The game logic is modular, with classes handling distinct responsibilities like player control, enemy behavior, and level management.

Game Mechanics: The Fairy character has unlimited magical abilities, but restrictions are imposed on usage during movement or flight to maintain game balance.

Level Design: The game features two levels with increasing complexity. Level 1 includes basic elements such as tiles, points, and enemies. Level 2 introduces additional obstacles, including disappearing elements like flowers, barrels, and cacti.

The codebase does not follow standard commenting conventions, and comments are in Romanian.
